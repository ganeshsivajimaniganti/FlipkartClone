## 🧠 Project Explanation

The **Flipkart Clone** project mimics the core front-end functionalities of the Flipkart website.  
It uses **HTML** for structure, **CSS** for styling and responsiveness, and **JavaScript** for interactivity.  

When the user opens the website:
1. A **banner slider** at the top automatically transitions between promotional images.
2. A **category bar** allows users to navigate between product categories such as *Phones, Electronics, Laptops*, etc.
3. On the **Home page**, all categories are displayed sequentially with their respective products below them.
4. When a category is clicked, only those products are shown dynamically.
5. Users can click the **Add to Cart** button to store product details locally.
6. The **footer** gives a brief about Flipkart’s presence and ends with your copyright.
